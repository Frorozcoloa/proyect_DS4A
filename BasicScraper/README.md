# How to Scrape Tweets from Twitter
This folder contains my jupyter notebooks for my basic scraping tutorial published [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1 "written article").

This folder's notebooks scrape tweets using two different packages in Python.
* GetOldTweets3
* Tweepy

-WORK IN PROGRESS - My code friendly folder is meant to contain scripts and jupyter notebooks that were meant to be code-friendly for people that don't have a strong understanding of Python but still want to scrape tweets on Twitter.
